## 1. ABOUT THE PROJECT
Creature Battle Arena is an isometric 2.5D combat system designed to be an alternative to menu-based combat found in certain JRPG franchises.
This menu-based design is static and outdated, and has not grown and innovated along with the rest of the industry. 

C. B. A. will use real-time combat, including player-driven creature movement and button-based combat.  
It is not intended to be a game concept in and of itself; rather, it is intended to be attached to an existing concept as a different form of 
gameplay which is more entertaining and more modern.

## 2. TECHNOLOGIES
This project will be designed using:
* Unity: 2019.4.19f1
* C\#

## 3. GAMEPLAY
### 3.1 CONCEPT
Creature Battle Arena is designed to be a real-time, action-oriented combat system designed around a game which uses collectable creatures
as the basis for its gameplay system. Instead of menu-based combat and limited player input, the player will actively control the movement and
abilities of their respective creature through specified button inputs.
