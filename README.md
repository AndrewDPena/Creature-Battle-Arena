# Creature-Battle-Arena
## A technical software project to create a battle system proof of concept.

# About the Project
Creature Battle Arena is an isometric 2.5D combat system designed to be an alternative to menu-based combat found in certain JRPG franchises.

This menu-based design is static and outdated, and has not grown and innovated along with the rest of the industry. C. B. A. will use real-time combat, including player-driven creature movement and button-based combat.  It is not intended to be a game concept in and of itself; rather, it is intended to be attached to an existing concept as a different form of gameplay which is more entertaining and more modern.
